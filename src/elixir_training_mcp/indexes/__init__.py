Index modules for the offline training data store.

The package is introduced ahead of a refactor that will move each lookup index
out of ``data_store.py``. Initially these modules are placeholders; behaviour
will remain defined in ``data_store`` until the subsequent steps populate the
new modules.
"""

# The concrete indexes are still defined in data_store.py and will be imported
# here once the refactor migrates their implementations.
