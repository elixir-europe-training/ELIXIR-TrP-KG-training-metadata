GeertvanGeest: As a life scientist	I want to quickly find events from a range of platforms such as TeSS and GTN in one search	…so that I can learn how to work on single cell transcriptomics data analysis in R	The course takes place between 1 and 3 months from now, and is a live course. Give me urls so I can investigate the courses. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you search for live training events about single cell transcriptomics in R within the next 1-3 months. Let me use our training materials search tools with appropriate date filtering.

First, let me calculate the date range (1-3 months from November 6, 2025):
- Start date: December 6, 2025
- End date: February 6, 2026 

Ran `local_date_search` 
Completed with input: {
  "start_date": "2025-12-06",
  "end_date": "2026-02-06"
}

Let me help you find relevant single cell transcriptomics courses in R from the search results. Looking specifically at live courses between December 6, 2025 and February 6, 2026 (your specified timeframe), I can see:

1. SIB Training Course: "Introduction to Sequencing-based Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis"
- Date: December 9-10, 2025
- Location: Bern, Switzerland
- Mode: Onsite
- URL: https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20251209_SBSRT
- While this course involves transcriptomics and R, it focuses specifically on spatial transcriptomics rather than single-cell analysis.

2. EMBL-EBI Course: "Single-cell RNA-seq analysis with Python"
- Date: February 2-6, 2026
- Mode: Online
- URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/single-cell-rna-seq-analysis-python-2026
- While this course covers single-cell RNA-seq analysis, it uses Python rather than R.

Let me perform another search to look specifically for single-cell RNA analysis courses: 

Ran `search_training_materials` 
Completed with input: {
  "search": "single cell RNA-seq analysis R course"
}

Based on these searches, here are the most relevant upcoming courses for your needs:

1. EMBL-EBI Course: "Single-cell RNA-seq analysis with Python"
- Date: February 2-6, 2026
- Mode: Online 
- URL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/single-cell-rna-seq-analysis-python-2026
- While this uses Python instead of R, it provides comprehensive coverage of scRNA-seq analysis.

Unfortunately, I don't see any courses specifically focused on single-cell transcriptomics using R during your specified timeframe (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026). However, there are a few alternative suggestions:

1. Consider the spatial transcriptomics course in Bern (Dec 9-10, 2025) as it covers related concepts and uses R.

2. Consider the Python-based EMBL-EBI course as the concepts will be transferable to R, and many tools have both Python and R implementations.

3. Look for courses starting after February 2026 or explore online self-paced resources like:
- SIB's single cell transcriptomics materials: https://github.com/sib-swiss/single-cell-training
- ISMB tutorials on single-cell analysis
- Various R/Bioconductor packages documentation (Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, etc.)

Would you like me to:
1. Search for courses after February 2026?
2. Look for online self-paced materials specifically for R-based single-cell analysis?
3. Provide more details about any of the courses mentioned above?
