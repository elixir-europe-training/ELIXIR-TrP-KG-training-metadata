GeertvanGeest: As a bioinformatics scientist	I want know how I can load single cell transcriptomics data into Seurat with a reference to training materials including their metadata	...so that I can learn how I can start with single cell transcriptomics analysis from a known resource

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you search for training materials related to single cell transcriptomics analysis with Seurat. Let me use the search functionality to find relevant training resources. 

Ran `search_training_materials` 
Completed with input: {
  "search": "single cell transcriptomics Seurat data loading analysis"
}

Let me try a more focused keyword search in the local database: 

Ran `local_keyword_search` 
Completed with input: {
  "query": "single cell seurat",
  "limit": 5
}

Let me also try searching specifically for topics related to Seurat: 

Ran `local_topic_search` 
Completed with input: {
  "topic": "seurat",
  "limit": 3
}

Based on the search results, I found several relevant training resources that cover single-cell RNA-seq analysis. While they don't specifically mention Seurat in their descriptions, these courses typically include Seurat as it's one of the most popular tools for scRNA-seq analysis. Here are the most relevant resources:

1. VIB Training: "Analysis of single-cell RNASeq data"
   - Next session: February 9-16, 2026 in Zwijnaarde, Belgium
   - This course covers the complete pipeline for analyzing scRNA-seq data
   - Key learning outcomes include:
     - Quality control and filtering
     - Normalization and noise reduction
     - Clustering and dimensionality reduction (UMAP)
     - Marker gene identification
     - Differential expression analysis
   - Location: VIB/UGent FSVM II, Technologiepark 75, Zwijnaarde, Belgium

2. Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop (CBW): "Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis"
   - Next sessions: June 1-3, 2026 (offered simultaneously in Toronto and Winnipeg)
   - Comprehensive 2-day course with hands-on tutorials
   - Prerequisites: Basic familiarity with Unix commands and R programming
   - Topics covered:
     - Tool installation
     - Read alignment and transcript quantification
     - Quality control
     - Data visualization and interpretation
     - Clustering and differential expression
     - Cell cluster annotation
     - Dataset integration

The VIB Training course in particular seems to be very comprehensive and hands-on, covering all aspects of scRNA-seq analysis including the data loading and processing steps you're interested in. 

For self-paced learning specifically about loading data into Seurat, I recommend checking these official resources (though they're not in our training database):
1. The official Seurat tutorials: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html
2. The Seurat data loading vignette: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html

Would you like me to search for any specific aspects of single-cell analysis or provide more details about any of these training resources?
