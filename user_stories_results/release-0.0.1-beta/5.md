I can help you explore this interesting approach to finding more accessible STEM materials! Let me search the training materials collection to see what we can discover about authors who span both STEM and social sciences domains.

Search Local datset stats   

Great! I can see we have 3,361 training resources to work with. Now let me search for materials that might span both STEM and social sciences domains. Let me try a few different approaches:

*Local Keyword Search*

Good start! I found some materials that mention "social sciences" in keywords or descriptions. Now let me search more specifically for digital humanities and look at topics to better understand the cross-disciplinary materials.

*Local topic search*

Excellent! Now let me check the authors/contributors of these materials to see if they also created STEM materials. Let me look for authors who appear in both types of content.

*Local provider search*

Perfect! Now I can see that **Saskia Hiltemann** and **Björn Grüning** appear in both Digital Humanities materials AND many STEM materials. Let me provide a comprehensive answer based on my findings.

Based on my analysis of the ELIXIR training materials collection, I've identified an interesting approach to finding STEM materials with potentially less technical language. Here's what I discovered:

**Key Findings:**

**Cross-Disciplinary Authors as Proxies for Accessible Materials**

I found several authors who have created materials spanning **both STEM and humanities/social sciences domains**, which suggests they may adopt a more accessible communication style:

1. **Saskia Hiltemann** (ORCID: 0000-0003-3803-468X)

   - Created Digital Humanities tutorials (OpenRefine, text mining)
   - Also authored numerous STEM materials (microbiome analysis, genomics, Galaxy administration)


2. **Björn Grüning** (ORCID: 0000-0002-3079-6586)

    - Contributed to Digital Humanities materials
    - Extensive STEM contributions across bioinformatics topics


3. **Daniela Schneider** (ORCID: 0000-0001-9536-5587)

    - Created Digital Humanities materials (Chinese text mining, cultural data analysis)
    - Also created plant genomics materials (transcription-associated proteins)


**Materials with Cross-Disciplinary Appeal**
I also identified materials that bridge disciplines:
- Data management and FAIR principles courses (BY-COVID project materials)
- Science communication training materials
- Statistical and data visualization courses that emphasize clear communication
- Research data management materials spanning life sciences, health sciences, and social sciences

**Recommendation Strategy:**
To implement your approach systematically, I suggest:

1. **Filter by these cross-disciplinary authors** using the provider search function
2. **Look for keywords indicating broader accessibility:**

"communication"
"visualization"
"introduction"
"fundamentals"
Courses mentioning both "life sciences" and broader audiences

3. **Check materials from Galaxy Training Network** - they have a strong representation of both Digital Humanities and STEM materials with consistent pedagogical approaches

Would you like me to generate a specific list of STEM materials created by these cross-disciplinary authors, or help you explore any particular topic area?
