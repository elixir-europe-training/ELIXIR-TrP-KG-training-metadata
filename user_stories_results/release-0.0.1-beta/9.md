# User Story 9: Metadata Verification Report

**As a training metadata curator** I want to verify the existing learning resource metadata on keywords and authors of the SIB course 'Multiomics data analysis and integration' against the course materials ...so that materials are described more richly and correctly making them more findable and interoperable. Once you found the metadata on TeSS. Find the course materials on GitHub. Browse through the course materials to verify the metadata. 

## Summary: Complete Metadata Verification

### TeSS Training Material Entry (`schema:LearningResource`)

**Location in harvest file:** `/data/tess_harvest.ttl` (lines 86117-86208)

**Has Authors!**
- **Julien Boccard**
- **Van Du Tran**
- **Florence Mehl**
- **SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics** (as an organizational author)

**Has Keywords:**
- "data analysis"
- "data integration"
- "multiomics"

**Additional metadata:**
- Educational level: "beginner"
- URL: https://github.com/sib-swiss/multiomics-data-analysis-and-integration-training

### TeSS Course/Event Entry (`schema:Course`)

**Location in harvest file:** `/data/tess_harvest.ttl` (lines 7340-7427)

**No authors** (the event entry doesn't include author information)
**Has same keywords:** "data analysis", "data integration", "multiomics"
- URL: https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20260305_MODAI

## Verification Against GitHub Materials

**Repository:** https://github.com/sib-swiss/multiomics-data-analysis-and-integration-training

### Authors Match Perfectly:

**From GitHub README:**
- Julien Boccard (Julien.Boccard@unige.ch) - Trainer, University of Geneva
- Florence Mehl (Florence.Mehl@sib.swiss) - Trainer, SIB
- Van Du Tran (thuong.tran@sib.swiss) - Trainer, SIB
- Monique Zahn (monique.zahn@sib.swiss) - Technical Coordinator, SIB Training Group

**In TeSS Material Entry:**
- Same three trainers are listed as authors
- SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics listed as organizational author

### Keywords Could Be Enriched

Based on the course materials from GitHub, here are **additional keywords that should be added**:

#### Statistical Methods

- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)
- **PLS** (Partial Least Squares)
- **CCSWA** (Common Component and Specific Weights Analysis)
- **ConsensusOPLS** (Consensus Orthogonal Partial Least Squares)
- **CCA** (Canonical Correlation Analysis)
- **dimensionality reduction**
- **supervised learning**
- **unsupervised learning**
- **multiblock analysis**

#### Omics Types (mentioned in course)

- **RNAseq**
- **metabolomics**
- **lipidomics**
- **proteomics**

#### Technical Tools/Technologies

- **R programming**
- **Bioconductor**
- **statistics**
- **statistical modeling**

#### R Packages Used (from `packages_installation.R`)

- **MBAnalysis**
- **mixOmics**
- **ropls**
- **ConsensusOPLS**
- **CCA**
- **ggplot2**
- **factoextra**

## Course Content Details

### Day 1 - Dimensionality Reduction

- Topics: PCA/PLS theory and exercises
- Files:
  - `MultiOmics_Intro_2025_print.pdf`
  - `Dimensionality_reduction.pdf`
  - `Practicals_Day_1.pdf`
  - R Markdown exercises on single block analyses and CCA

### Day 2 - Multiblock Analyses

- Topics: Unsupervised (CCSWA) and supervised (ConsensusOPLS) methods
- Files:
  - `MultiOmics_Data_Integration_2025_print.pdf`
  - `Practicals_Day_2.pdf`
  - R Markdown exercises on multiblock analyses

## Recommendations

### 1. Authors Are Correct

The training material entry correctly captures all three trainers as authors. No changes needed.

**Note:** Consider adding Monique Zahn as a contributor (Technical Coordinator).

### 2. Significantly Enrich Keywords

**Current keywords (3):**

- data analysis
- data integration  
- multiomics

**Recommended additions (25+ keywords):**

**Core Methods:**

- PCA
- PLS
- CCSWA
- ConsensusOPLS
- CCA
- dimensionality reduction
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- multiblock analysis

**Application Domains:**

- RNAseq
- metabolomics
- lipidomics
- proteomics

**Technical:**

- R programming
- Bioconductor
- statistics
- statistical modeling
- data integration methods

This would bring the total from **3 keywords to 28+ keywords**, dramatically improving:

- **Findability** - More search terms match the content
- **Interoperability** - Better alignment with standard vocabularies
- **Accuracy** - Keywords reflect actual course content

### 3. Event vs Material Entry Consistency

The course/event entry (schema:Course) does NOT include authors, while the material entry (schema:LearningResource) does. This is acceptable as:

- Events typically focus on organizational metadata
- Materials focus on authorship and content

However, both could benefit from keyword enrichment.

## Conclusion

**Authors are correctly captured in the training material entry**  
**Keywords are present but minimal**  
**Primary Recommendation:** Significantly enrich the keywords to improve findability and better represent the rich technical content of the course

**Impact:** The metadata is **accurate but could be much richer** to improve discoverability and interoperability across training registries and knowledge graphs.
