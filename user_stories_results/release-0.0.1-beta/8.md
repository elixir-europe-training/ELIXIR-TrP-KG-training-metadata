GeertvanGeest: As a training metadata curator	I want identify training metadata that is missing or conflicting on events and materials	...so that I can update and correct false or missing metadata

GitHub Copilot: Let me help you analyze the training metadata for missing or conflicting information. I'll use the tools available to search through the harvested training data and provide insights about potential metadata issues.

Let me first check what metadata statistics we have available: 

Ran `local_dataset_stats` 
Completed with input: {}

Based on the dataset statistics and metadata content, I can help identify several areas where metadata might be missing or conflicting. Here are the key findings:

1. Resource Type Distribution:
- Most resources (2,474 + 657) are Learning Resources
- Only 223 are marked as Courses
- Very few (7) are marked as Events
This suggests possible inconsistency in resource type labeling.

2. Access Mode Coverage:
- Only 648 resources have specified access modes (textual/visual)
- This means over 2,700 resources are missing access mode information

3. Audience Role Coverage:
- Only 648 total audience role assignments across:
  - Students (503)
  - Galaxy Administrators (97) 
  - Instructors (48)
- This means most resources (~2,700) lack audience targeting information

Let me check some specific examples using the search functionality: 

Ran `local_keyword_search` 
Completed with input: {
  "query": "missing audience OR missing access mode OR missing difficulty level",
  "limit": 5
}

Based on the sample search results and earlier statistics, here are the key metadata issues that need attention:

1. Missing Core Metadata:
- Language information is frequently missing
- Educational levels are often unspecified
- Access mode information is missing for most resources

2. Inconsistent Resource Typing:
- Many resources could be more specifically categorized (e.g., some courses might be incorrectly labeled as general learning resources)
- Event labeling is particularly sparse (only 7 events marked)

3. Audience Information Gaps:
- Most resources lack audience role specifications
- When specified, roles are limited to three categories (Students, Galaxy Administrators, Instructors)
- Missing difficulty/skill level indicators for many resources

4. Accessibility Information:
- Most resources lack accessibility controls information
- Accessibility features are rarely specified
- Accessibility summaries are missing

5. Temporal Metadata:
- Many resources are missing date_published and date_modified information
- Course instances often lack detailed timing information

Recommendations for improvement:

1. Standardize Resource Types:
- Review and properly categorize resources as Course, Event, or Learning Resource
- Ensure consistent application of type definitions

2. Enhance Accessibility Documentation:
- Add access mode information for all resources
- Document accessibility features and controls
- Include accessibility summaries where possible

3. Expand Audience Information:
- Add target audience roles for all resources
- Expand the range of audience roles beyond the current three categories
- Include difficulty/skill level indicators

4. Complete Core Metadata:
- Add language information for all resources
- Specify educational levels consistently
- Include temporal information (publication/modification dates)

5. Standardize Prerequisites and Learning Objectives:
- Ensure all resources have clear prerequisites listed
- Add structured learning objectives/outcomes

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of these findings or provide more specific examples of resources needing attention?
