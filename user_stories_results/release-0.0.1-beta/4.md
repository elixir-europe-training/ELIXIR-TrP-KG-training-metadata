GeertvanGeest: As a package maintainer for the Bioconductor package SingleCellExperiment	I want to find all materials created that use my package	…so that I can offer quality assurance checks for materials generated outside my reach

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you search for training materials that mention or use the SingleCellExperiment Bioconductor package. Let me use the search functionality to find relevant training materials. 

Ran `search_training_materials` 
Completed with input: {
  "search": "SingleCellExperiment Bioconductor package training materials"
}

Let me try a more focused keyword search approach: 

Ran `local_keyword_search` 
Completed with input: {
  "query": "SingleCellExperiment",
  "limit": 10
}

I apologize, but I'm not finding any direct matches for training materials using SingleCellExperiment in the current dataset. This could mean either:

1. The materials haven't been properly tagged with the package name
2. The materials exist but aren't currently indexed in the training registry
3. The materials are referenced using different terminology

Here are a few suggestions for moving forward:

1. You could broaden your search to look for single-cell RNA-seq analysis training materials in general, as these might include your package without explicitly mentioning it in the metadata.

2. Consider:
   - Creating your own training materials and registering them in TeSS (ELIXIR's Training Portal)
   - Adding package usage examples to your Bioconductor vignettes
   - Collaborating with training providers to ensure your package is properly referenced in their materials

3. You might want to search directly on platforms like:
   - ELIXIR TeSS (https://tess.elixir-europe.org)
   - Galaxy Training Network
   - Bioconductor's own training materials

Would you like me to:
1. Search for broader single-cell RNA-seq analysis training materials?
2. Look for materials from specific training providers that commonly create Bioconductor-related content?
3. Try a different search approach with specific terms you'd like to focus on?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I'll help you find the most relevant materials.
