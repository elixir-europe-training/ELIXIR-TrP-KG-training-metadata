GeertvanGeest: As a bioinformatics scientist	I want to find training materials on loading single cell data as a Seurat object	...so that I can learn how I can start with single cell transcriptomics analysis from a known resource

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you search for training materials related to loading single cell data into Seurat objects. I'll use the search functionality to find relevant training materials. 

Ran `search_training_materials` 
Completed with input: {
  "search": "loading single cell data Seurat object transcriptomics analysis"
}

Let me try a keyword search to see if we can find relevant materials. 

Ran `keyword_search`

Based on your interest in learning how to load single cell data as a Seurat object for transcriptomics analysis, I found several relevant training materials from the Galaxy Training Network. Here are the most relevant resources:

1. **[Filter, plot, and explore single cell RNA-seq data with Seurat (R)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_FilterPlotandExploreRStudio/tutorial.html)**
   - This tutorial is specifically designed for working with Seurat in R
   - Covers the complete workflow from loading data to analysis
   - Perfect for beginners
   - Teaches you how to:
     - Load and process single cell data
     - Make informed decisions about analysis parameters
     - Perform quality control
     - Generate and annotate cell clusters

2. **[Importing files from public atlases](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/EBI-retrieval/tutorial.html)**
   - Shows you how to obtain single cell data from public repositories
   - Guides you through formatting the data for use with Seurat
   - Teaches you how to:
     - Retrieve data from EBI Single Cell Expression Atlas
     - Manipulate metadata and matrix files
     - Create a Seurat object from public data

3. **[Clustering 3K PBMCs with Seurat](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-seurat-pbmc3k/tutorial.html)**
   - A hands-on tutorial using a real dataset (3K PBMCs)
   - Walks through the complete Seurat pipeline
   - Teaches you how to:
     - Evaluate data quality
     - Filter low quality cells
     - Prepare data for analysis with Seurat
     - Perform clustering

I recommend starting with the first tutorial (Filter, plot, and explore single cell RNA-seq data with Seurat (R)) as it's specifically designed for beginners and covers the fundamentals of working with Seurat. Then you can move on to the other tutorials to learn about working with public data and see a complete analysis workflow with a real dataset.

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any of these tutorials or help you get started with a particular aspect of single cell analysis with Seurat?
