	abstract = {Translational research requires data at multiple scales of biological organization. Advancements in sequencing and multi-omics technologies have increased the availability of these data, but researchers face significant integration challenges. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to model complex phenomena, and methods exist to construct them automatically. However, tackling complex biomedical integration problems requires flexibility in the way knowledge is modeled. Moreover, existing KG construction methods provide robust tooling at the cost of fixed or limited choices among knowledge representation models. PheKnowLator (Phenotype Knowledge Translator) is a semantic ecosystem for automating the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) construction of ontologically grounded KGs with fully customizable knowledge representation. The ecosystem includes KG construction resources (e.g., data preparation APIs), analysis tools (e.g., SPARQL endpoint resources and abstraction algorithms), and benchmarks (e.g., prebuilt KGs). We evaluated the ecosystem by systematically comparing it to existing open-source KG construction methods and by analyzing its computational performance when used to construct 12 different large-scale KGs. With flexible knowledge representation, PheKnowLator enables fully customizable KGs without compromising performance or usability.},

	abstract = {Stand-alone life science training events and e-learning solutions are among the most sought-after modes of training because they address both point-of-need learning and the limited timeframes available for “upskilling.” Yet, finding relevant life sciences training courses and materials is challenging because such resources are not marked up for internet searches in a consistent way. This absence of markup standards to facilitate discovery, re-use, and aggregation of training resources limits their usefulness and knowledge translation potential. Through a joint effort between the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET), the Bioschemas Training community, and the ELIXIR FAIR Training Focus Group, a set of Bioschemas Training profiles has been developed, published, and implemented for life sciences training courses and materials. Here, we describe our development approach and methods, which were based on the Bioschemas model, and present the results for the 3 Bioschemas Training profiles: TrainingMaterial, Course, and CourseInstance. Several implementation challenges were encountered, which we discuss alongside potential solutions. Over time, continued implementation of these Bioschemas Training profiles by training providers will obviate the barriers to skill development, facilitating both the discovery of relevant training events to meet individuals’ learning needs, and the discovery and re-use of training and instructional materials., In the absence of understandable and readily implementable standards for life science training resources such as courses, materials, data, etc., such resources are difficult to locate or to harmonize in a central repository. From a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reuse) principles lens, this gap hinders findability and by extension accessibility, which, in the field of bioinformatics training, is a critical problem. Our work describes the standards development process and the finalized web metadata standards for life science training resources (Course, CourseInstance, TrainingMaterial). It builds upon existing metadata standard creation processes such as that from Schema.org and narrows down the standards to those relevant for life science audiences (under Bioschemas.org). Importantly, our work considers the hurdles of implementing metadata standards within existing training resource websites and lowers the barrier to implementation by describing a set of minimum standards needed for each training profile. With the recent release of our life science–focused training standards, we have seen rapid uptake among the bioinformatics training community highlighting the need for such standards in both the bioinformatics and broader life science training communities.},

To address this issue, we have developed a new platform—TeSS—which aggregates geographically distributed information and presents it in a central, feature-rich portal. Data are gathered automatically from content providers via bespoke scripts.

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
